NOTE: This guide uses Multi-Tenancy DATABASE mode. To learn more, read http://guides.grails.org/database-per-tenant/guide/index.html[Database per Tenant Multi-Tenancy] Guide.

This guides shows a typical flow you will see when creating a SaaS ( Software as a Service ) application using Multi-Tenancy `DATABASE` mode.

To simplify this guide, the Database provising process is simplified.

Create two MySQL databases with the following schema.

[source, sql]
----
CREATE TABLE `plan` (
  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `version` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
----

The first database should be called `gru` and the second `vector`.

In the guide application, when a user registers, a database with identical name as the username is provisioned for the user, thus each registered user will have their own unique database.

In a real-world app you will probably have a more complicated setup which may involve saving the database url and credentials of each user's database in a secured way in a database table of the default datasource.
