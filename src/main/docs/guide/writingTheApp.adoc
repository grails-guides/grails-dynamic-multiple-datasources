To simplify this guide, the Database provising processed is simplified.

Create two MySQL databases with the next schema.

[source, sql]
----
CREATE TABLE `plan` (
  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `version` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
----

Named one database `gru` and the other `vector`.

In the guide app, when a user registers, a database with identical name as the username is wired-up.

In a real-world app you will probably have a more complicated setup which may involve saving up the database url and credentials of each
user's database in a secured way in a database table of the default datasource.
